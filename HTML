				<h2>Hello World!</h2>
				<p>Welcome everyone to my website.
				My name is Dana and I am 20 years old. I am studying in The Hague University of Applied Sciences, User Experience Design course. As a part of this study I need to create a website. For a long time I was thinking what I should write about and I decided to tell you about my favourite kinds of music! I concider myself a person, who can listen all types of music. But I will only talk about 3 music genders: Russian music (because I am Russian :) ), Korean music and some Metal music. I will tell something about how I started to listen to this specific band and provide videos.</p>
				<p2>I hope you will enjoy!! And you have any questions, you can contact me by filling in the form on the right!</p2>
