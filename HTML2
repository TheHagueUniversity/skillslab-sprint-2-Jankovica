				<h2>Big Bang</h2>
				<p>I started to listen to this band when I was around 13 years old. Back at that time I was fan of Korean culture. I was listening Korean music almost all of the time. And even a lot of time have passed and now I am a different human being I still love this band. In my opinion, they are the best! Hope you will enjoy their latest music video, which is provided below!</p>

<!-- REVIEW
Overall, take a good look at the examination form, you don't seem to understand what you'll be graded upon
Also take a look at the assignment, these two pages don't cover the requirements
-->
